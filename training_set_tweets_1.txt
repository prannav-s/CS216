94	5297587573	#treat is awesome, but #trick is more fun.	2009-10-30 15:59:16
94	5294072552	You can learn a lot about how people see you by how you're listed.  For example, it seems that people feel strongly that I work at Twitter.	2009-10-30 13:22:28
94	5283079531	I'm not sure when I switched from reading books in bed just before going to sleep to checking email, but I don't think it's healthy.	2009-10-30 04:08:35
94	5272759628	Another headphones cable on the fritz.  I need to buy these things in bulk.	2009-10-29 18:36:12
94	5251644931	@audomatic Get a magical parking card.  http://bit.ly/zpKsH  Available pre-tax through WageWorks.	2009-10-29 00:00:36
94	5242444115	Ok then.  I'm just going to hold off for a little while and react to this later.	2009-10-28 17:28:12
94	5210165808	Also, my iPhone just swapped "better" for "heterosexual".  After all these years, sometimes I feel like you don't know me AT ALL, iPhone.	2009-10-27 15:33:45
94	5209931467	I'm beginning to think this day would have gone better if I had started it differently.  Mainly if I'd skipped the getting out of bed part.	2009-10-27 15:23:58
94	5195359828	I just finished season one of The Tudors, and omg you guys--you'll never believe how it ends!	2009-10-27 02:12:13
94	5188234229	@Nexus6 Perhaps ideal for the undead.	2009-10-26 19:45:39
94	5188207757	It's a good thing I have this never-ending mountain of email to sort though.  Otherwise waiting on these tests would be boh-rring.	2009-10-26 19:44:38
94	5180613248	Setting up a translink card.  This process seems unduly complicated.	2009-10-26 14:28:19
94	5142288914	I want there to be substantially less waiting in my day to day life.	2009-10-25 01:55:15
94	5138306663	@telene That sounds... bad.  You should go to a doctor.	2009-10-24 21:53:53
94	5114848007	Embroidery: cooler than you would think.	2009-10-23 22:26:15
94	5111157859	@delbius called me a "pretty little hate machine".  It made me blush.	2009-10-23 19:27:28
94	5110209440	"Don't cloud the wonder of this week with your little ...facts."	2009-10-23 18:41:49
94	5056784093	I block for misdirected @ replies.	2009-10-21 19:36:17
94	5050055129	@robey No. I would burn alive contentedly at my laptop without ever having heard the fire alarm.	2009-10-21 14:12:31
94	5700482171	Finally figured it out.  There's only one escalator at this Bart station.  It changes direction depending on the time of day.	2009-11-13 21:51:41
94	5697640155	@sara That looks really nice.  It's almost like we're a real company of grown-ups.	2009-11-13 19:43:14
94	5697506646	My new plates are so pretty, it makes me want to put better food on them.	2009-11-13 19:36:31
94	5671233822	Oh, sigh.  I always have to do things the hard way, don't I?	2009-11-12 22:42:30
94	5661511222	@evan Oh sure, tell all the crazies.  Thanks a lot.	2009-11-12 16:19:09
94	5660181647	I'm watching the shipping casualty of this move hasten to its doom from the tracking page. Poor little guy. He has no idea what he's in for.	2009-11-12 15:27:46
94	5657550179	Theory: translink will only work on muni if you have $2  in your pocket as backup.	2009-11-12 13:40:20
94	5656487467	@stop Wow.  Just... wow.	2009-11-12 12:55:15
94	5643267594	Took a chance on some molasses clove cookies.  Oh yeaaah, I live on the wild side.  And it's tasty here.	2009-11-12 00:55:51
94	5643217224	@TheBloggess What timezone are you in?  Because if being up at 11pm makes you an insomniac then... *pats your head*	2009-11-12 00:52:16
94	5641566056	@audomatic Yes, and then she loaned it to me.  But I can assure you, we both knew what we were getting into.	2009-11-11 23:12:51
94	5640420949	Anyone who believes that you cannot judge a book by its cover has not seen the cover of this book:  http://amzn.com/0373621353	2009-11-11 22:16:26
94	5639005516	The prospect of a new office on Monday fills me with the kind of hope that scares me.  (That is, any.)	2009-11-11 21:16:22
94	5638663876	Adventures in testing:   "Think of something witty for me to say, quick!". 
"Uh... sorry, I can't do that."	2009-11-11 21:02:21
94	5629909728	Just remembered my stressful dream.  I sure hope @jenna isn't mad at me still.	2009-11-11 15:31:09
94	5609990215	@odinsdream Well, hello fellow moocher.  Thanks for getting to it so quickly!	2009-11-10 22:19:28
94	5601168400	@cw Oh, wait!  NOW I GET IT!

Eh hem.  I mean, hah.  That was funny.	2009-11-10 16:19:20
94	5594242643	Today in cute: Cinder eats with his hands.  Scoops up each piece of kibble with his paw and head tilted, daintily dishes it into his mouth.	2009-11-10 11:35:11
94	5573588580	Nothing will make you realize just how dumb something is as trying to explain it to someone else.	2009-11-09 18:04:52
94	5569725162	The one thing that USPS has on UPS, FedEx and all other carriers:  the forwarding address.	2009-11-09 15:38:23
94	5567207554	"We sincerely appreciate your feedback.  But please note, there is a 250 character limit.  Max exceeded."  Turns out I only needed four.	2009-11-09 13:53:48
94	5515547528	I'm going to be a full hour late to this thing.  My only excuse?  C'mon, it's Saturday.	2009-11-07 15:31:30
94	5499835794	Donated to a public artistic preformance for the first time in years.  It was both striking and silent.	2009-11-06 23:18:51
94	5497020620	I wish the iPhone "wrong password" error notice when unlocking your phone was a little less... mean.  Cut me some slack guys, it was a typo.	2009-11-06 21:00:57
94	5466886554	Thinking warm, congratulatory thoughts towards the people who made that thing happen.  You know who you are.	2009-11-05 19:49:50

94	5457416676	I need something to cheer me up from my somber contemplation.  Oh, this economics book will do quite nicely.  What?  "Dismal" is realtive.	2009-11-05 13:22:25
94	5457166950	. @CapnWiley Yeah, everyone loves evernote. Only problem is, it's a great example of everything I don't want in my note taking app.	2009-11-05 13:11:36
94	5454819827	Wanted: a lightweight, fast, simple note taking web app that stores to the cloud and is on iphone.  Note: omnifocus does not qualify AT ALL.	2009-11-05 11:29:54
94	5440215081	@mattknox That is exactly as it should be.	2009-11-04 21:38:22

94	5425223781	What ever happened to smelling salts anyway?  Oh.  "Ammonia gas is toxic in large concentrations for prolonged periods, and can be fatal..."	2009-11-04 11:21:47

94	5319336536	@ericwright I don't get the hate people have for Nickelback. Sure, they're poppy and derivative--but since when does that inspire such rage?	2009-10-31 13:17:16
94	5309216138	@ded Critical mass represents almost, but not quite everything that I hate about San Francisco.	2009-10-31 02:06:12
