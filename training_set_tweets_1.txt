94	5297587573	#treat is awesome, but #trick is more fun.	2009-10-30 15:59:16
94	5294072552	You can learn a lot about how people see you by how you're listed.  For example, it seems that people feel strongly that I work at Twitter.	2009-10-30 13:22:28
94	5283079531	I'm not sure when I switched from reading books in bed just before going to sleep to checking email, but I don't think it's healthy.	2009-10-30 04:08:35
94	5272759628	Another headphones cable on the fritz.  I need to buy these things in bulk.	2009-10-29 18:36:12
94	5251644931	@audomatic Get a magical parking card.  http://bit.ly/zpKsH  Available pre-tax through WageWorks.	2009-10-29 00:00:36
94	5242444115	Ok then.  I'm just going to hold off for a little while and react to this later.	2009-10-28 17:28:12
94	5210165808	Also, my iPhone just swapped "better" for "heterosexual".  After all these years, sometimes I feel like you don't know me AT ALL, iPhone.	2009-10-27 15:33:45
94	5209931467	I'm beginning to think this day would have gone better if I had started it differently.  Mainly if I'd skipped the getting out of bed part.	2009-10-27 15:23:58
94	5195359828	I just finished season one of The Tudors, and omg you guys--you'll never believe how it ends!	2009-10-27 02:12:13
94	5188234229	@Nexus6 Perhaps ideal for the undead.	2009-10-26 19:45:39
94	5188207757	It's a good thing I have this never-ending mountain of email to sort though.  Otherwise waiting on these tests would be boh-rring.	2009-10-26 19:44:38
94	5180613248	Setting up a translink card.  This process seems unduly complicated.	2009-10-26 14:28:19
94	5142288914	I want there to be substantially less waiting in my day to day life.	2009-10-25 01:55:15
94	5138306663	@telene That sounds... bad.  You should go to a doctor.	2009-10-24 21:53:53

94	5056784093	I block for misdirected @ replies.	2009-10-21 19:36:17
94	5050055129	@robey No. I would burn alive contentedly at my laptop without ever having heard the fire alarm.	2009-10-21 14:12:31
94	5700482171	Finally figured it out.  There's only one escalator at this Bart station.  It changes direction depending on the time of day.	2009-11-13 21:51:41
94	5697640155	@sara That looks really nice.  It's almost like we're a real company of grown-ups.	2009-11-13 19:43:14
94	5697506646	My new plates are so pretty, it makes me want to put better food on them.	2009-11-13 19:36:31
94	5671233822	Oh, sigh.  I always have to do things the hard way, don't I?	2009-11-12 22:42:30
94	5661511222	@evan Oh sure, tell all the crazies.  Thanks a lot.	2009-11-12 16:19:09
94	5660181647	I'm watching the shipping casualty of this move hasten to its doom from the tracking page. Poor little guy. He has no idea what he's in for.	2009-11-12 15:27:46
94	5657550179	Theory: translink will only work on muni if you have $2  in your pocket as backup.	2009-11-12 13:40:20
94	5656487467	@stop Wow.  Just... wow.	2009-11-12 12:55:15
94	5643267594	Took a chance on some molasses clove cookies.  Oh yeaaah, I live on the wild side.  And it's tasty here.	2009-11-12 00:55:51
94	5643217224	@TheBloggess What timezone are you in?  Because if being up at 11pm makes you an insomniac then... *pats your head*	2009-11-12 00:52:16
94	5641566056	@audomatic Yes, and then she loaned it to me.  But I can assure you, we both knew what we were getting into.	2009-11-11 23:12:51

94	5639005516	The prospect of a new office on Monday fills me with the kind of hope that scares me.  (That is, any.)	2009-11-11 21:16:22
94	5638663876	Adventures in testing:   "Think of something witty for me to say, quick!". 
"Uh... sorry, I can't do that."	2009-11-11 21:02:21
94	5629909728	Just remembered my stressful dream.  I sure hope @jenna isn't mad at me still.	2009-11-11 15:31:09
94	5609990215	@odinsdream Well, hello fellow moocher.  Thanks for getting to it so quickly!	2009-11-10 22:19:28
94	5601168400	@cw Oh, wait!  NOW I GET IT!

94	5594242643	Today in cute: Cinder eats with his hands.  Scoops up each piece of kibble with his paw and head tilted, daintily dishes it into his mouth.	2009-11-10 11:35:11
94	5573588580	Nothing will make you realize just how dumb something is as trying to explain it to someone else.	2009-11-09 18:04:52
94	5569725162	The one thing that USPS has on UPS, FedEx and all other carriers:  the forwarding address.	2009-11-09 15:38:23

94	5515547528	I'm going to be a full hour late to this thing.  My only excuse?  C'mon, it's Saturday.	2009-11-07 15:31:30
94	5499835794	Donated to a public artistic preformance for the first time in years.  It was both striking and silent.	2009-11-06 23:18:51
94	5497020620	I wish the iPhone "wrong password" error notice when unlocking your phone was a little less... mean.  Cut me some slack guys, it was a typo.	2009-11-06 21:00:57
94	5466886554	Thinking warm, congratulatory thoughts towards the people who made that thing happen.  You know who you are.	2009-11-05 19:49:50

94	5457166950	. @CapnWiley Yeah, everyone loves evernote. Only problem is, it's a great example of everything I don't want in my note taking app.	2009-11-05 13:11:36
94	5454819827	Wanted: a lightweight, fast, simple note taking web app that stores to the cloud and is on iphone.  Note: omnifocus does not qualify AT ALL.	2009-11-05 11:29:54

48059781	6040410442	@IamATL makes no sense to put him in FCW he is already marketable and can work.  They should run him like TNA did for Nigel/Desmond	2009-11-24 22:20:43

45089102	5929361313	Well, I probably have a deck to phone in a winning record if I decide to go to States. And by winning, I just mean more wins than losses.	2009-11-21 16:03:54
45089102	5925827378	Nailed it.: http://wp.me/puhGm-3Y	2009-11-21 13:20:27
45089102	5924262871	Actually, I really would, because I find people boring in general, but, you know... The general point remains.	2009-11-21 12:08:59
45089102	5924239482	@mtgcolorpie @dosman711 Yeah, I'd certainly hate to be one of the few guys in a theater full of Twilight's excitable key 18-24 demographic.	2009-11-21 12:07:55
45089102	5921438883	@TericAylor06gt Aaaaand done. No more random status updates will get pushed through to your Twitter feed.	2009-11-21 10:04:09
45089102	5921254180	@TericAylor06gt Okay, we need to break that link, Eric. Give me a few moments to go smashface on it in the admin panel.	2009-11-21 09:56:00
45089102	5919775761	@MarzGurlProd Ken Masters from any Street Fighter anime, Rufus is debatable because he has very little prominence in the SF4 anime shorts.	2009-11-21 08:45:52
45089102	5919545436	@MarzGurlProd Oh, and of course, also from the second YuGiOh series, Maximillion Pegasus, the first major villain.	2009-11-21 08:34:35
45089102	5919500075	@MarzGurlProd Because if you mean nationality, the second YGO series had Keith Howard and Rebecca Hopkins as supporting characters.	2009-11-21 08:32:17
45089102	5919407193	@MarzGurlProd Can you explain on what you mean by American characters? Characters with a US nationality, or whose property is from the US?	2009-11-21 08:27:42
45089102	5898890538	@mtgcolorpie Allow me to don my "social journalist" hat a moment to say that it makes perfect sense considering the demographic distinction.	2009-11-20 14:04:12
45089102	5898775723	@MarzGurlProd I'm a fan of Seattle myself, but realistically convenience should probably be the deciding factor.	2009-11-20 13:59:37
45089102	5878066685	I know, it's not their fault... It's... A really unfortunate situation.	2009-11-19 21:00:14
45089102	5877951186	So... How about that US Magic team at Worlds? Hrm.	2009-11-19 20:55:44
45089102	5868887220	Oh, yeah; new DrawGo Radio is up. http://drawgoradio.blip.tv/file/2870953/	2009-11-19 15:10:32
45089102	5868877406	Yes, you're really trying your hardest to control demographic targeting to make a profit, I know, but YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.	2009-11-19 15:10:10
45089102	5868860110	So I have to wonder why Facebook keeps rearranging itself and going live with targeting algorithms that don't work and kill bandwidth.	2009-11-19 15:09:30
45089102	5864449878	Watch Audacity make a liar of me. Episode 6 is facing some technical difficulties and is upsetting me greatly. It'll be up shortly.	2009-11-19 12:18:00
45089102	5862614494	FLYNN! There was the rogue element all along... Kurt Cobainu Reeves himself...	2009-11-19 11:06:02
45089102	5862500467	Seriously, I want to choke slam whoever is shuffling those cards. Ambience is one thing, but bloody Hell.	2009-11-19 11:01:42
45089102	5862322712	Whoever keeps shuffling in the background of the latest DrawGo Radio? You're doing wonders for noise correction.	2009-11-19 10:54:58
45089102	5861803106	Enjoy, dear audience, as we construct a narrative around the narrative.	2009-11-19 10:35:07
45089102	5861789129	Now, is it editorial fiat or noblesse oblige..?	2009-11-19 10:34:36
45089102	5861728353	Editorial powers also encompass the ability NOT to cut things... As my "talent" shall soon discover.	2009-11-19 10:32:19
45089102	5842487890	This is where my mind goes when I spend the night watching TGWTG videos to try and fight insomnia.	2009-11-18 18:24:00
45089102	5842472478	But, you know... Paulsen gave him a biting, scathing edge to his dialogue, instead of brute force stereotyping.	2009-11-18 18:23:24
45089102	5842436099	He'll always be Raphael to me; I don't mind the direction more recent actors have taken with him, because he's believable as a Bronx tough.	2009-11-18 18:22:04
45089102	5842416526	Man... Fight Club gave the name Rob Paulsen a weird infamy.	2009-11-18 18:21:19
45089102	5842359563	@MarzGurlProd You know, never thought to check before now, but I'm surprised Rob Paulsen wasn't more prominent in that show. Hn.	2009-11-18 18:19:11
45089102	5841731387	So save your 1200 MS points, people.	2009-11-18 17:55:46
45089102	5841725719	They just didn't try enough; the adds between the player and the gameplay (navigation, etc) don't engage, just break up the flow of action.	2009-11-18 17:55:33
45089102	5841637593	...But it's a reinterpretation that really brings nothing new other than window dressing.	2009-11-18 17:52:17
45089102	5841624139	I can give them credit for creative reinterpretation of the mechanics and challenges like "time pressure", etc...	2009-11-18 17:51:47
45089102	5841582825	It's shallow for a puzzle game. And no, I don't mean shallow compared to, say, Puzzle Quest (though yes), shallow compared to say Bejeweled.	2009-11-18 17:50:14

21365075	6162953544	I have a feeling that a lot of women will take issue with Von Trier about the film, but I think that's a bit silly. He's right about nature.	2009-11-28 23:57:53

15729017	6447314822	@r_c Right. Understanding intent & crafting relevant messaging around it are the steps you take to get to ROI -- the conversion continuum.	2009-12-07 18:25:13
15729017	6446656536	@r_c I may intend to buy but it doesn't count as a result (or success) until I actually buy it. Metrics refinement against tangible return.	2009-12-07 18:03:14
15729017	6446602867	@r_c This whole discussion stemmed from impressions vs actions as a metric, in which case intent ? return. There's no ROI on intent alone.	2009-12-07 18:01:24
15729017	6446267358	@r_c I could argue that if you've done a good enough job targeting & profiling your consumer, you know the intent & can use to drive action.	2009-12-07 17:49:52
15729017	6444794257	@audio Agreed & in that manner, you invest in the relationship to deliver resonant, behavior-driving content.  Sparked intent --&gt; conversion	2009-12-07 16:57:51
15729017	6444570013	@audio We're still saying different things. Intent to buy is not the same as actually buying it. We need to measure actions, not intentions.	2009-12-07 16:49:48
15729017	6444431193	@audio My stance is centered around random mass push vs tailoring efforts to reaching the right audience. Latter=less views, greater return.	2009-12-07 16:44:48
15729017	6443882307	@audio But that goes back to my original point about reaching targeted viewers vs unqualified eyeballs. See, I'm strategic like that. ;)	2009-12-07 16:24:58
15729017	6443488229	Measuring intent's virtually useless. Measure action. Doesn't matter if consumers intend to do something. Matters when they actually do it.	2009-12-07 16:10:34
15729017	6443287344	@kmullett Right. 10k relevant views=infinitely better than 100k who'll never convert to brand. Too many chase mainstream vs nurturing niche.	2009-12-07 16:03:12
15729017	6442860756	@filmfuturist Agree. Prob is megabrands w/$ to orchestrate a transmedia initiative are tightening the purse strings after 'failed' attempts.	2009-12-07 15:47:32

15729017	6441734457	@filmfuturist Agree it'll help put the experience in focus but there have been transmedia successes. This is still largely a niche strategy.	2009-12-07 15:03:58
15729017	6441546925	@filmfuturist I heave that sigh on a daily basis. Focus must be on creating compelling content viewers will want to champion+engage deeper.	2009-12-07 14:56:56
15729017	6441298208	@filmfuturist That hasn't been my experience b/c agencies usually tout impressions as the success metric vs engagement/action.	2009-12-07 14:47:20
15729017	6441236004	@filmfuturist 100% correct. It's much easier to promise views than orchestrate a multi-faceted experience that actually engages viewers.	2009-12-07 14:44:58
15729017	6441174501	@filmfuturist They're using views as a way to squeeze maximum $ out of clients but when campaign ultimately fails, brands blame branded ent.	2009-12-07 14:42:30
15729017	6440867849	Manufactured buzz is not a success metric.	2009-12-07 14:30:28
15729017	6440852128	I often say some of the most successful branded entertainment campaigns out there you've probably never heard of b/c you're not the target.	2009-12-07 14:29:54
15729017	6440813045	@jasonzada Right, but millions of unqualified views won't advance the brand. The key is to create resonant content for the *right* audience.	2009-12-07 14:28:23
15729017	6440792364	@filmfuturist Of course not! You can easily identify those schemes when it's 100k views & 3 comments. Those 'guarantees' hurt the category.	2009-12-07 14:27:35
15729017	6440762235	@kmullett Exactly-anyone can inflate views but it won't drive results if they're not relevant to the brand or actually engage w/the content.	2009-12-07 14:26:22
15729017	6440726742	I'm willing to bet that those 'guarantees' are nothing more than purchased views or gaming the system via auto-play and the like.	2009-12-07 14:24:59

15729017	6423196411	@wrighteous1 I was merely pointing out that simply a web series moving over to TV does not make it a transmedia experience.	2009-12-07 00:01:28

15729017	6423158591	@wrighteous1 I'm a big fan of niche segments & cable is certainly perfect for that. I'd like to see more media-interlinking stories, though.	2009-12-06 23:59:42

15729017	6421676304	@charmfx I think those are valid points, among many others. Corp politics around prod/distro + risk aversion also spawn indie creation.	2009-12-06 22:46:44

14287342	5599992727	@Daimoku7 My kids don't go near these types of games period. But as a gamer - I have conflicts about the games content. That sucks.	2009-11-10 15:33:23
14287342	5599973916	@Daimoku7 True, parents have the duty to not allow children to play things like this. But I'm a parent, and I play. This isn't about my kids	2009-11-10 15:32:37
14287342	5599188291	@sktjr169 I think even more than translation, its just excessive poor taste to move that type of an atrocity into "entertainment". My view.	2009-11-10 15:01:18
14287342	5598970277	@sktjr169 Especially in light of recent events. Their last release was such a great game - sad to see this one take a jump into this territo	2009-11-10 14:52:33
